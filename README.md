# v-beers

This project was created to learn V lang basics, as well as common use cases similar to other languages I use regularly. I'll be recording my experiments and what I've learned while treking through V.

# Practices

* [http.v]() - TBD
* [structs.v]() - TBD
* [error.v]() - TBD
* [io.v]() - TBD
* [list.v]() - TBD
* [num.v]() - TBD
* [string.v]() - TBD

# Experiments

* [ ] Create a locale package, module, or library and utilize.
* [ ] Leverage vpm package manager for 3rd party packages.
* [ ] Read from environmental variables.
* [ ] Read from a file in a local directory.
* [ ] Create a basic DTO (data transfer object).
* [ ] Marshal and unmarshal DTO to string and V struct.
* [ ] Expose REST endpoints for experiment application.
* [ ] Create a service description for my RESt endpoints, following the HATEOAS model.
* [ ] Handle multiple different HTTP verbs.
* [ ] Dockerize application (include 3rd party packages).
* [ ] Create unit tests and execute on a CI/CD platform.
* [ ] Connect to a relational database (Postgres).
